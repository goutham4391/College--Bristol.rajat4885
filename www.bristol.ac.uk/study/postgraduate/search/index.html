The degree serves as the entry qualification for professional practice and employment in educational psychology. It has been designed to meet the professional training needs of educational psychologists and reflects a shift in orientation in professional training that is implicit in a research degree.
The programme's academic and research goals are:

To create an advanced level of knowledge in the areas of child development, educational psychology, special educational needs, assessment and intervention, childhood diversity, family dynamics and educational systems. Assessment is by written assignments.
To provide instruction in research methodology to doctoral level (you will be required to complete a 45,000-word dissertation).

Each EngD research project is designed around the sponsor company's research priorities.
The EngD programme is run by the Industrial Doctorate Centre (IDC) in Composites Manufacture, which is embedded within the EPSRC Future Composites Manufacturing Research Hub. EngD students benefit from the use of cutting-edge equipment and expertise at the universities and at the National Composites Centre, which provides a world-class facility to bridge the gap between research and industrial application.
The IDC aims to provide the UK composites manufacturing industry with EngD graduates who are equipped with the advanced technical and leadership skills required for effective adoption of new knowledge and technologies in composites manufacture. The relevant industry areas include aerospace, automotive, marine, wind energy and construction.</p></div><div class="search-result__meta"><dl><dt>Modes of study</dt><dd>Full-time, Part-time</dd><dt>Awards available</dt><dd>EngD</dd></dl></div></div></a></article><article class="search-result search-result--course"><a href="../2023/eng/engd-future-innovation-in-non-destructive-evaluation/index.html"><div class="search-result__inner"><div class="search-result__taxonomy"><div class="search-result__badge">Research postgraduate programme</div></div><div class="search-result__main"><h1>EngD Future Innovation in Non-Destructive Evaluation</h1><p>The EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Innovation in Non-Destructive Evaluation (FIND CDT) has been created to provide EngD and PhD programmes in the vital field of non-destructive evaluation: an underpinning technology that encompasses a wide range of sensing, imaging and analysis techniques.
FIND-CDT connects universities with industry. The result is research that makes a difference &ndash; EDF, Airbus and E.ON are just a few of the companies our students have worked with to create real impact.
The University of Bristol leads, alongside centre partners Imperial College London and the Universities of Manchester, Nottingham, Strathclyde and Warwick. The CDT has been co-created by a consortium of 49 companies, including Airbus, Rolls-Royce, EDF, BAE Systems and Shell.
The CDT has close links to the UK&rsquo;s internationally leading Research Centre for Non Destructive Evaluation with a vibrant network of more than 250 researchers across a range of disciplines based in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, physics, mathematics and imaging sciences departments in the participating universities.
With these partners, we have developed bespoke cohort-based doctoral training to equip our CDT graduates with the breadth and depth of knowledge that UK industry requires across this multidisciplinary subject. EngD and PhD students will be trained by leading academic and industrial experts through taught modules on the core technical disciplines, as well as in responsible innovation and entrepreneurship and an industrially linked doctoral research project.
This responds to rapidly changing needs of UK industry and a society that demands low costs with high levels of safety and reliability. This need is driven by many factors such as new materials, advanced manufacturing technologies, digitalisation, the Internet of Things, robotic systems, the civil nuclear renaissance and the pressing requirement to extend the life of our ageing national infrastructure.
The combination of breadth and depth of training equips our graduates with the broad interdisciplinary technical skills to deliver innovative solutions across key industrial sectors and the transferable skills needed to become future innovators and industry leaders.
The Bristol group is recognised as a world leader within NDE, having produced several important research outcomes that are now exploited by industry, both in the UK and around the world.</p></div><div class="search-result__meta"><dl><dt>Modes of study</dt><dd>Full-time, Part-time</dd><dt>Awards available</dt><dd>EngD, PhD</dd></dl></div></div></a></article><article class="search-result search-result--course"><a href="../2023/ssl/graduate-diploma-economics/index.html"><div class="search-result__inner"><div class="search-result__taxonomy"><div class="search-result__badge">Taught postgraduate programme</div></div><div class="search-result__main"><h1>Graduate Diploma Economics</h1><p>For students interested in an MSc in Economics or Economics and Finance after an undergraduate degree in a different discipline, this fast-track programme provides essential training in economics and econometrics in preparation for a specialist master's programme.</p></div><div class="search-result__meta"><dl><dt>Modes of study</dt><dd>Full-time</dd><dt>Awards available</dt><dd>Graduate Diploma</dd></dl></div></div></a></article><article class="search-result search-result--course"><a href="../2023/ssl/llm-law---banking-and-finance-law/index.html"><div class="search-result__inner"><div class="search-result__taxonomy"><div class="search-result__badge">Taught postgraduate programme</div></div><div class="search-result__main"><h1>LLM Law - Banking and Finance Law</h1><p>Our LLM in Banking and Finance provides you with an opportunity to access a highly sought-after, technically complex and constantly evolving area of law - and graduate to meet a growing demand for expert lawyers that can embrace challenges and innovation whilst ensuring businesses are financially and legally robust.

Translators are change-makers through the texts they produce. The online MA Translation prepares you to find your individual voice as a translator, become a confident user of translation technologies, explore ethical questions in relation to clients and colleagues, and develop your entrepreneurial skills. The programme is offered in French, German, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Spanish, and Portuguese, and translation is primarily from these languages into English.
The MA Translation belongs to a highly select group of global programmes that are formally validated by the Chartered Institute of Linguists (CIOL). They describe the programme as:
'A programme embedded in both academic and professional contexts that delivers an excellent preparation for linguists seeking a career in translation. Drawing on current practice, emerging trends and future language specialisms, the programme anticipates developments in the translation industry which will affect the working lives of aspiring translators. Students embarking on the programme can be confident that they will emerge equipped with the professional skills and knowledge they need to be work-ready to enter the translation industry.'
The programme is also a corporate member of the Institute of Translation and Interpreting (ITI).
In this online programme, teaching and learning primarily happen in asynchronous, interactive seminar groups, led by specialists in language and community, CAT tools and MT, subtitling, multilingualism, poetry, theory, translation as a service, and video game localisation and accessibility. Several tutors have extensive industry experience and continue to work as translators alongside their activities on the programme. Our library holds a very wide range of e-books and e-journals on translation.
Our student body is exceptionally diverse. Some have recently completed their undergraduate degree; others have professional experience in the language industry or elsewhere and are looking for a career change. Asynchronous learning is particularly suited to students with family or work commitments alongside their study.
In addition to asynchronous core unit components, academic and personal tutors offer non-compulsory synchronous meetings, and synchronous interaction between students is facilitated through a virtual common room. We organise a programme of online talks and seminars each year, and while you are not required to come to campus, you are just as much a member of the University as any other student, and we would be delighted to welcome you to Bristol if you wanted to visit.</p></div><div class="search-result__meta"><dl><dt>Modes of study</dt><dd>Full-time, Part-time</dd><dt>Awards available</dt><dd>MA, PG Diploma (Postgraduate Diploma)</dd></dl></div></div></a></article><article class="search-result search-result--course"><a href="../2023/ssl/mres-advanced-quantitative-methods/index.html"><div class="search-result__inner"><div class="search-result__taxonomy"><div class="search-result__badge">Taught postgraduate programme</div></div><div class="search-result__main"><h1>MRes Advanced Quantitative Methods</h1><p>This MRes programme is only open to 1+3 SWDTP funded PhD students.

This programme focuses on Inclusive Education. It explores and critiques barriers in society that prevent disabled people's (and individuals with labels of 'special' educational needs) inclusion and participation as individuals with rights to citizenship. It rejects charity and individual deficit model interpretations that have - and continue to - place disabled people as in need of charity, cure, treatment and care. The programme draws upon the lived experiences of disabled people, their self-organisation, user-led campaigns for justice and equality in education.
The programme introduces a fundamental conceptual shift in understanding the purpose and function of education, asking questions about who it benefits and who it excludes. Alongside raising questions about the discrimination and exclusion of disabled people from mainstream society, it explores their active participation in education, further and higher education. It critiques the use and notion of 'special' with reference to the shifting educational terminology in contemporary society. It discusses the place of personal experience with reference to the intersectionality between age, gender, 'race', religion, sexuality and social class, and takes a cross-cultural perspective. It draws upon (critical) disability studies within education and is supported by current research, practice and theory. It also explores the policy and legislative context and provides an international perspective, particularly highlighting the issue of human rights.
The programme is designed to develop your knowledge, understanding and critical skills in the analysis and evaluation of current research, theory and practice for learners experiencing barriers to participation.

As such, composites are replacing traditional materials for lightweight structures at an unprecedented rate due to global demand (for example in the aircraft, wind turbine, construction and automotive industries). The sector growth is expected to be rapid, in the region of 5-10% each year.&nbsp;
The composites sector is contributing significantly to industry developments. Advanced composites are technology-enabling and critical to the production of lighter, smarter wing structures; or more efficient wind turbines that yield cheaper, more abundant energy. With the already encroaching effects of climate change, composite materials and structures have an important role to play in contributing to reductions in CO2 emissions and the growing need for a more sustainable future.&nbsp;
The UK has invested heavily in the science, engineering, and technology of composite materials, including the establishing of the National Composites Centre at the University of Bristol. A highly skilled workforce and technical leadership are required to support the industry; this leadership requires a radical and innovative mindset that encompasses engineering knowledge as well as the physical sciences.&nbsp;
The development of future composites and their applications will require doctoral students with a knowledge of advanced materials science,&nbsp;engineering, and sustainability, together with practical experience of the resulting composites and structures. These highly-skilled engineers not only need to understand technical subjects but should also be able to apply their acquired knowledge within the context of the modern world.&nbsp;

By exploring new objects of study and innovative methodologies, we have forged interdisciplinary connections in and beyond the arts and social sciences via themes of global concern, from mental health to climate change.
Transnational studies emphasise cultural difference and diversity yet also interconnectedness and mutual influence. We explore cultural contact, migration and transfer within and beyond Europe in uneven colonial, pre-colonial, and postcolonial contexts, both vertically and transversally, while questioning persistent narratives of &lsquo;West&rsquo; and &lsquo;East&rsquo; or &lsquo;North&rsquo; and &lsquo;South&rsquo;.
Intermedial studies build on our excellence in word and image studies, film and theatre, auditory culture, and the study of such cultural artefacts as video games, graphic novels, manga, the media, landscape design, and artwork from video installation to graffiti.
We also explore the materiality of discursive genres (poetic form, the novel, ego documents and political rhetoric), and how literary and discursive practices interact with social, political and professional contexts. Comparative Literatures and Cultures draws on the extensive research specialisms of our staff. Each research student is assigned a supervisor who works in their proposed area of research or related field, and benefits from the input of a second supervisor who will likely come from another department, depending on the nature of the project. Supervisory teams may include staff from other schools and departments within the Faculty of Arts and beyond, for example in Classics, English, Drama, History, or Philosophy.
Our postgraduates are fully integrated in a professionally and personally supportive departmental and school community.

The critical element will place the creative work in an informed and theorised analytical context.
The total assessed word count will be 25,000 words for the MPhil and 80,000 words for the PhD (or equivalent for poetry). The proportion of the creative to the critical work will be agreed by the supervisory team, but in total will usually consist of around 65-70% of creative text and 30-35% of critical text.
All postgraduate research students are supervised by two academics, one of whom will normally be a creative writing academic and the other from English Literature or a related discipline relevant to the creative and critical work. As with the traditional research degrees, the final submission will be expected to make &lsquo;a substantial and original contribution to knowledge&rsquo;. For Creative Writing, this means a body of work that contributes in individual, significant and demonstrable ways to current discourses in literature.
The relation to such discourses will be articulated in the creative work and conceptualised and explored in the critical element; both are intended to address the same research questions, generating dynamic interplay between creative and critical practice.</p></div><div class="search-result__meta"><dl><dt>Modes of study</dt><dd>Full-time, Part-time</dd><dt>Awards available</dt><dd>PhD, MPhil</dd></dl></div></div></a></article><article class="search-result search-result--course"><a href="../2023/eng/phd-cyber-security-tips-at-scale/index.html"><div class="search-result__inner"><div class="search-result__taxonomy"><div class="search-result__badge">Research postgraduate programme</div></div><div class="search-result__main"><h1>PhD Cyber Security (TIPS at Scale)</h1><p>Within the next few years, the number of devices connected to each other and the Internet will outnumber humans by almost five to one. These connected devices will underpin everything from healthcare to transport to energy and manufacturing. This growth is not just in the number or variety of devices, but also in the ways they communicate and share information with each other, building hyper-connected cyber-physical infrastructures that span most aspects of people's lives.
To maximise the socioeconomic benefits from this revolutionary change, we need to address the myriad trust, identity, privacy, and security issues raised by such large, interconnected infrastructures. Solutions to many of these issues have previously only been developed and tested on systems orders of magnitude less complex in the hope they would 'scale up'. However, the rapid development and implementation of hyper-connected infrastructures means that we need to address these challenges at scale since the issues and the complexity only become apparent when all the different elements are in place.
This centre for doctoral training tackles this issue by training a new generation of interdisciplinary research leaders - educating PhD students in both the technical skills needed to study and analyse TIPS-at-scale, while simultaneously studying how to understand the challenges as fundamentally human too. Students will learn from experts from the Universities of Bristol and Bath, from each other as an interdisciplinary cohort, and from experts from industry.

Students are encouraged to develop a topic of interest that directly relates to their own background or practice experiences, or is of wider interest and relevance to the science underpinning the promotion and maintenance of health of populations, via physical activity and/or nutrition, either in UK nations or overseas.
Students will be supported to develop research questions and design a study that enables them to rigorously research their topic of interest and make an original contribution to the knowledge base of physical activity and/or nutrition in relation to public health. Topics may directly explore policy or practice issues, or contribute more broadly to physical activity and nutrition knowledge, working with specific population groups and communities, addressing systems of inequality and social disadvantage. Where appropriate, students are encouraged to work in collaboration with relevant organisations and/or user and interest groups to ensure their research outputs and key findings can directly inform policy, professional development, practice and service delivery.
Supervisors in Exercise, Nutrition and Health bring diverse interests across epidemiology (for example, associations between physical activity/diet and a range of chronic diseases across population groups); physical activity and dietary assessment (for example, development of indices to assess adherence to dietary patterns); the development and evaluation of physical activity and dietary interventions and/or services (for example, community programmes, school settings); and behaviour change (including the wider determinants of physical activity and diet and the psychological underpinnings of physical activity, nutrition and health).
Supervisors also have diverse expertise in research methods, such as qualitative methods (for example, informing and evaluating the development of interventions or service delivery); secondary data analysis (for example, using nationally representative population surveys and large prospective studies/big data); and scoping and systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the evidence base in physical activity and nutrition.

It explicitly recognises that traditional approaches to security and conflict must encompass different disciplinary perspectives on issues of human (in)security to develop better strategies for resolving conflicts and protecting human rights.
This programme is one of five South West Doctoral Training Partnership interdisciplinary pathways delivered in partnership with the Universities of Bath and Exeter.
Globalisation has altered the security environment, and violence has shifted from organised inter-state war to protracted warfare fought by non-state actors and local militias as well as state militaries. Climate change, forced migration, gender-based violence, radicalisation, humanitarian emergencies, terrorism and WMD proliferation have - to varying degrees - been securitised by states, intergovernmental institutions and non-governmental organisations. This broadening of the global security agenda has highlighted the limits of existing local, regional and global responses to these new challenges, and although human rights are codified within international law, their implementation is often inhibited.
This PhD responds directly to these challenges and equips researchers with the interdisciplinary skills required to shape the research, policy and practice needed to prevent conflict and mitigate security risks.
As this is an interdisciplinary PhD pathway, within your proposal you will be required to articulate, clearly and substantively, how and in what ways your proposed research is interdisciplinary in nature. You should also be aware that an offer of a place on this programme is dependent on the availability of co-supervision from two staff members from different disciplines relevant to your proposal. You are required to identify this in the 'proposed supervisor' section of your application.
Students will normally be registered in the school of their first supervisor.

The partnership is made up of a number of disciplinary and interdisciplinary pathways. For details of the pathways available at Bristol, please see the apply to the SWDTP section of our website. The pathway you are interested in will determine which programme you will need to apply to through the online application system. Each programme has its own entry in the programme finder where you will find further details of research activities and potential supervisors.
The SWDTP offers funding for 1+3 or +3 awards in a range of disciplines and interdisciplinary themes. Students will normally be registered in the school of their first supervisor. This may not be the school that processes your application.</p></div><div class="search-result__meta"><dl><dt>Modes of study</dt><dd>Full-time, Part-time</dd><dt>Awards available</dt><dd>PhD, MRes, MSc</dd></dl></div></div></a></article><article class="search-result search-result--course"><a href="../2023/ssl/phd-sustainable-futures/index.html"><div class="search-result__inner"><div class="search-result__taxonomy"><div class="search-result__badge">Research postgraduate programme</div></div><div class="search-result__main"><h1>PhD Sustainable Futures</h1><p>The interdisciplinary pathway in sustainable futures seeks to produce a new generation of researchers who can address the pressing social issues of sustainability in the face of a growing global population.
Sustainability research asks how human wellbeing can be maintained and enhanced in the long term, given rising populations, limited natural resources and a fragile environment. The field, with its clear applied focus and strong strategic future-directed policy implications, has social sciences at its heart.
It also requires a broad interdisciplinary approach and an understanding of economics, law, the politics and psychology of sustainability, and the geography and demographics of those affected. We therefore deliberately expose students to a broad range of material to help them appreciate and understand interconnected perspectives and to provide them with skills to work effectively across disciplines. We welcome students from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds.
Students will normally be registered in the school of their first supervisor. This may not be the school that processes your application.</p></div><div class="search-result__meta"><dl><dt>Modes of study</dt><dd>Full-time, Part-time</dd><dt>Awards available</dt><dd>PhD</dd></dl></div></div></a></article><article class="search-result search-result--course"><a href="../2023/sci/phd-technology-enhanced-chemical-synthesis/index.html"><div class="search-result__inner"><div class="search-result__taxonomy"><div class="search-result__badge">Research postgraduate programme</div></div><div class="search-result__main"><h1>PhD Technology Enhanced Chemical Synthesis</h1><p>Based at the School of Chemistry, our alternative to the traditional PhD offers a unique training period designed to strengthen your research techniques and introduce new technologies for Chemical Synthesis through lab rotations. You will benefit from developing a range of transferable skills (including presentation, teamwork and problem-solving) to enhance your employability.
After successfully completing the training element, you will embark on a lab research project in Chemical Synthesis. During this time, your scientific development will continue to be enhanced by entrepreneurship training and further professional and academic courses provided by our industrial partners. As a result, you will end your PhD as a well-rounded candidate for both industry and academia.
